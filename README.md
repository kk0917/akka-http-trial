Akka HTTP Trial
===========================================

## What do I wanna do?

I want to create an easily API by using Akka HTTP to prepare for a full-fledged web application.

## What is Akka HTTP?

**Philosophy**

"Akka HTTP has been driven with a clear focus on providing tools for building integration layers rather than application cores. As such it regards itself as a suite of libraries rather than a framework."

[Quoted from the official website](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/introduction.html#philosophy)
